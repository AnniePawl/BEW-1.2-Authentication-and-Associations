# Web 2 Class 1

## Welcome

Welcome to Web 2.

Think of this as a work environment rather than a traditional class. 
In a work environment you work in a team. Team members help each other 
and the goal is to produce the best work possible as a team. 

As team members you are not in competition, instead it is your goal to 
support each other in the work they are doing. 

### Your Job

It is your job to schedule time and complete the work assigned to you. 
You will be working on several projects over the course of 6 weeks. 

The first project is to complete the Reddit Clone Tutorial. This is
built with Node and Express JS with MongoDB. You should complete this 
by following the tutorial. Your goal is to complete it by the end of 
the second week.

  - You can also follow this tutorial [here](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Node-Reddit-Clone) on GitHub if you prefer

The second project is a custom project of your design. This should be 
built using Node and Express JS, with MongoDB. Borrow as much as you
like from the Reddit project. This project should be finished before 
the end of this term.

It's also your job to complete the challenges presented in class. 
Each week class should provide challenges to solve. You are required
to complete these challenges each week!
