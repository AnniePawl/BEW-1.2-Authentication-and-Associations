# Day X: Advanced Schema Design

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Review MongoDB schema basics at a high-level.

## Initial Exercise - Draw That DB Schema! (15 Minutes)

### Activity

Before class, prepare the large whiteboard with a few hand-drawn schema diagrams for reference purposes. Additionally, randomly split students into three groups. Write them on the whiteboard.

Distribute mini-whiteboards, and instruct each group to discuss and draw one of each of the following...

1. (Group 1) An example of a **One-to-One _(1:1)_** relationship.
1. (Group 2) An example of a **One-To-Many _(1:N)_** relationship.
1. (Group 3) An example of a **Many-to-Many _(N:N)_** relationship.

Allow **7 minutes** for students to discuss and draw their assigned models.

Once complete, **instruct students to hold up their whiteboards in order to contrast and compare their examples with one another.

Bring the class back together and ask a few leading follow up questions:

1. _Which examples did you find most relatable?_
1. _Which schema do you think would be the most difficult to implement in the real world?_
1. _How would you decide which schema to choose?_

## Overview / TT (20 Minutes)

## BREAK (10 Minutes)

## In Class Activity I: Theater Reservations API Continued (

Continue working on the Theater Reservations API that was assigned last class period. 

Remind students that this time is ideal for consulting with peers or asking in depth questions of the instructor. 

Be sure to offer students a mini code review.

## Wrap Up (15 Minutes)

### Poll Everywhere (8 Minutes)

You've been delegated a new task at work. Your mission? Teach the latest group of incoming junior programmers the advanced MongoDB concepts required on the job. You have four hours to accomplish this task. How would you approach the mission?

### Discuss Results (7 Minutes)
After 8 minutes have passed, project the anonymous results on the screen. Utilize the remainder of the class period to candidly and openly discuss each feedback item as they fade in. 

## After Class

Continue work on the Reddit Tutorial. It's due next class!
