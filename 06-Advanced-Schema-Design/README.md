# Day X: Advanced Schema Design

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Review MongoDB schema basics at a high-level.

## Initial Exercise - Draw That DB Schema! (20 Minutes)



Before class, prepare the large whiteboard with a few hand-drawn schema diagrams for reference purposes.

Distribute mini-whiteboards, and instruct each student to draw...

1. An example of a **One-to-One _(1:1)_** relationship.
1. An example of a **One-To-Many _(1:N)_** relationship.
1. An example of a **Many-to-Many _(N:N)_** relationship.

Allow **5 minutes** for each example.

After **each challenge** listed above, instruct students to hold up their whiteboards in order to contrast and compare their examples with one another.

Bring the class back together and ask a few leading follow up questions:

1. _Which examples did you find most relatable?_
1. _Which schema do you think would be the most difficult to implement in the real world?_
1. _How does one decide which schema to choose?_
