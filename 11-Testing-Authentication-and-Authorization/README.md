### Reading (10 Minutes)

Please read [this 2018 article](https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-in-2018-f68950900bc3) that focuses on a modern-day approach to testing in JavaScript. This article contains quite a bit of review of what we covered on [Day 9](../09-TDD/README.md) but also **introduces more advanced topics that we'll dive into during today's lesson**!

### Reflection (10 Minutes)

Answer the following questions in your notes:

1. What is a **mock**?
1. What is a **stub**? How is a **mock different from a stub**?
1. What is a **spy**?

If you finish the reflection early, further discuss your answers with your peers.
