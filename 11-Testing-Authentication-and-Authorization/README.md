## Learning Objectives/Competencies (5 Minutes)

## Initial Exercise (20 Minutes)

### Reading (10 Minutes)

Please read this article on [How to Test NodeJS Apps using Mocha, Chai and SinonJS](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-test-nodejs-apps-using-mocha-chai-and-sinonjs). Primarily focusing on a modern-day approach to testing in JavaScript, this article contains quite a bit of review with regards to what we covered on [Day 9](../09-TDD/README.md). Keen eyes will also note that this article  **introduces more advanced topics** that we'll **dive into during today's lesson**!

### Reflection (10 Minutes)

Answer the following questions in your notes:

1. What is a **mock**?
1. What is a **stub**? How is a **mock different from a stub**?
1. What is a **spy**?

If you **finish the reflection early**, further **discuss, compare, and contrast** your answers **with your peers**.

## Overview / TT (20 Minutes)

## In Class Activity I (20 Minutes)

### Sinon + Mocha + Chai Setup

## BREAK (10 Minutes)

## In Class Activity II (XX Minutes)

### Challenges

## Wrap Up (XX Minutes)

## After Class

Continue to practice Test Driven Development by **implementing authentication and authorization test cases** for your [Custom API Project](../Projects/02-Custom-API-Project.md).
