## Learning Objectives/Competencies (5 Minutes)

## Student Deployment Q&A (30 Minutes)

Allow approximately 30 minutes to allow students to ask you any and every question regarding how to deploy their APIs.

Walk students through topics of common interest. Distinctly outline the pros and cons of each:

* Heroku/cloud deployments.
* Virtual private servers.
* Bare bones servers.

## BREAK (10 Minutes)

## In Class Activity I (40 Minutes)

### Everyone Do: Need a Hand Deploying?

Assist students in deploying their projects.

## In Class Activity II (15 Minutes)

Utilize [Poll Everywhere](https://pollev.com/droxey) to project a live poll on the screen. Ask for students candid thoughts, feelings, and reflections about what they learned and experienced during the term.

Thank students for their hard work, dedication, and participation in class all term!

It was tough, but they did it!

Once submissions begin streaming in, read and respond to student feedback.

## Wrap Up (5 Minutes)

Remind students that they need to turn in their [Custom API Project](../Projects/02-Custom-API-Project.md) tonight at 11:59pm.

## After Class

Deploy your [Custom API Project](../Projects/02-Custom-API-Project.md) utilizing what we learned in class today.
