# Node.js Nuts and Bolts

## Intro

If we are just using node and node modules, we might never need to really understand what's happening under the hood of node itself. But as soon as we want to modify the modules we are using or if we want to write our own modules or if we want to solve exotic problems, we're going to need to know what is going on. We might also just be curious!

## Competencies & Objectives

1. List Node.js's unique features.
1. List some of Node.js's major affordances and limitations.
1. Compare and contrast Node.js with other web servers.
1. Draw a picture of the JS event loop and how Node.js uses it to respond to requests.
