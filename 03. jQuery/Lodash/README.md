# Lodash 

Lodash is a library that contains many utility functions. 
These are functions that perform standard operations and 
data manipulation. 

Lodash performs opertion that might be awkward or difficult to
implement with vanilla JavaScript. 

Use Lodash to sort filter and map data. 

For example while JavaScript has native map, filter, and 
reduce methods Lodash implements expanded versions of 
these. 

## Lodash vs jQuery 

Lodash and jQuery serve difference purposes. Where jQuery is 
concerned with managing the DOM, Lodash is all about working
with data.
